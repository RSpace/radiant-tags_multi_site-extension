= Tags Multi Site

This extension makes the tags extension multi_site aware.

Almost needless to say, it requires the tags and multi_site extensions installed. They must also be loaded before this extension, but that happens automatically because the extensions are loaded alphabetically.

Once you have installed the extension, you must upgrade you database:

% rake radiant:extensions:tags_multi_site:migrate
